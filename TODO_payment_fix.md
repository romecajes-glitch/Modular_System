# Payment Success Flow Fix - TODO List

## Objective
Fix the payment success flow to display session_count and payment details after successful payment instead of redirecting to dashboard with generic message.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. [x] Modify PaymentController::success() method
- [x] Change redirect to render payment.blade.php view
- [x] Pass payment details (session_count, amount, transaction_id, etc.)
- [x] Include the newly created payment record
- [x] Pass success message data

### 2. [x] Update payment.blade.php
- [x] Add logic to display payment success details when available
- [x] Show prominent success message with payment summary
- [x] Display session_count, amount, and transaction details
- [x] Ensure new payment appears in payment history

### 3. [ ] Testing
- Test the payment flow to ensure details are displayed
- Verify success message includes all relevant information
- Confirm payment history is updated correctly

## Files to Modify
- app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php
- resources/views/Student/payment.blade.php

## Expected Outcome
After successful payment, users should see:
- Payment confirmation with session_count displayed
- Amount paid and transaction details
- Success message with specific payment information
- The payment should appear in the payment history table
