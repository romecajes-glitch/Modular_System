# Recent Activities Display Fix

## Issue: Payments not showing in Recent Activity section of dashboard

### Analysis:
- The `getRecentActivities()` method in StudentController already fetches payment activities
- Payments are queried with status 'completed' and payment_date within last 30 days
- The issue might be that payments are not being saved correctly or payment_date is not set

### Steps to Fix:
1. [x] Added debug logging to getRecentActivities() method to track payment retrieval
2. [ ] Check if payments are being saved with correct status and payment_date
3. [ ] Verify the payment relationship in User model
4. [ ] Test the payment flow to ensure payments are recorded properly
5. [ ] Check if there are any issues with the payment_date field in database

### Current Status: Debug logging added

### Next Steps:
- Test making a payment and check the logs to see if payments are retrieved
- If payments are retrieved but not displayed, check the dashboard template rendering
- If payments are not retrieved, check the payment saving logic in PaymentController

### Debug Information Added:
- Logs payment query execution with count and payment details
- Logs final activities collection before returning
- Logs when no recent activities are found
