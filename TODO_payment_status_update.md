# TODO: Update Student Payment Status Change

## Current Status
- StudentController's processPayment method sets registration_fee_paid to true but does not change enrollment status to 'enrolled'
- AdminController's confirmOnsitePayment method changes status to 'enrolled' upon admin confirmation
- Need to ensure status changes to 'enrolled' when student pays registration fee directly

## Tasks
- [x] Update StudentController processPayment method to change enrollment status to 'enrolled' when registration fee is paid
- [x] Add validation to ensure enrollment is in 'approved' status before allowing payment
- [x] Add payment_type column to payments table for filtering
- [x] Test the payment flow to ensure status changes correctly
- [x] Verify admin confirmation flow still works properly

## Files to Update
- app/Http/Controllers/StudentController.php

## Expected Behavior
- When student pays registration fee through StudentController, enrollment status should change from 'approved' to 'enrolled'
- Admin confirmation flow should continue to work as before
- Status should only change if enrollment is currently 'approved'

## Changes Made
- Added validation to ensure enrollment is in 'approved' status before processing registration fee payment
- Updated processPayment method to set enrollment status to 'enrolled' when registration fee is paid
- Added proper error messages for invalid enrollment status
- Created migration to add payment_type column to payments table (enum: 'registration', 'session')
- Updated Payment model to include payment_type in fillable array
- Ran migration to apply database changes
